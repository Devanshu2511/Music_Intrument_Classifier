# Music_Intrument_Classifier
This is a simple classifier that is able to detect single-note sounds of various musical instruments. Currently supported types are cello, clarinet, flute, violin and piano. The audios are supposed to be single-note sounds.

#Dataset
The dataset used to train this classifier was collected from London Philharmonic Orchestra Dataset (http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/sound_samples). Each audio file records one note from one of the five instruments, and has a length from 0.25 seconds to 6 seconds.
